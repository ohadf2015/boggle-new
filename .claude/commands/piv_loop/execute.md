# Execute: Implement from Plan

## Plan to Execute

Read plan file: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Example:** `.claude/agents/plans/example-feature-address-validation.md`

## Execution Instructions

### 1. Read and Understand

**CRITICAL: Read the ENTIRE plan carefully first!**

- Read the plan file from start to finish
- Understand all tasks and their dependencies
- Note the validation commands to run
- Review the testing strategy
- **Read all "MUST READ" files listed in the plan**

**DO NOT skip this step!** The success of one-pass implementation depends on thorough understanding.

### 2. Read Prime Context

Before starting implementation, read the prime context:

```bash
Read .claude/agents/context/prime-context.md
```

This provides the overall codebase context that the plan builds upon.

### 2.5. Verify Feature Branch

**CRITICAL: You MUST be on a feature branch!**

Check current branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on `main` branch:**
1. **STOP** - Do not implement on main!
2. Ask user: "Should I create a feature branch for this implementation?"
3. If approved, create branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
4. Then proceed with implementation

**If on feature branch:**
- ✅ Continue with implementation
- Verify branch name is descriptive (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `fix/login-bug`)

**Rationale:**
- Protects main branch from uncommitted changes
- Allows for review before merging
- Facilitates rollback if needed
- Standard practice for team collaboration

### 3. Read All Mandatory Files

The plan lists files under "CONTEXT REFERENCES > Relevant Codebase Files (MUST READ!)"

**Read each file carefully:**
- Pay attention to patterns used
- Note naming conventions
- Understand error handling
- Observe logging patterns

**Example:**
```bash
# Read controller pattern
Read backend/src/main/java/com/example/controller/ExampleController.java

# Read service pattern
Read backend/src/main/java/com/example/service/ExampleService.java

# Read entity pattern
Read backend/src/main/java/com/example/entity/Example.java
```

### 3.5. Verify TDD Compliance Before Implementation

**🚨 CRITICAL: You MUST follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle!**

For EACH task in "STEP-BY-STEP TASKS":

**Step 1: CHECK Test Exists (RED Phase)**
- Does test file exist for the code you're about to write?
- If NO → **STOP!** Write test FIRST (use test-writing skill)
- If YES → Continue to Step 2

**Step 2: VERIFY Test Fails (RED Phase)**
- Run the test to verify it FAILS (RED)
- If test passes → You're missing test logic, fix test first
- If test fails → **GOOD!** Continue to Step 3

**Step 3: Implement Code (GREEN Phase)**
- Write MINIMAL code to make the test pass
- Run test again to verify it PASSES (GREEN)
- If test fails → Fix implementation until test passes

**Step 4: Refactor (REFACTOR Phase)**
- Improve code while keeping tests green
- Run tests again to ensure nothing broke
- If tests break → Fix refactor or revert

**ZERO TOLERANCE:**
- ❌ Code written before tests **WILL BE DELETED**
- ❌ NO exceptions for "simple code" or "just this once"
- ❌ If you violate TDD, **DELETE CODE** and start over

**TDD Enforcement:**
- **test-driven-development skill** will auto-activate and enforce this
- **test-writing skill** will enforce Given-When-Then pattern
- Follow the cycle: **Test first, implement second, refactor third**

### 4. Execute Tasks in Order

For EACH task in "STEP-BY-STEP TASKS":

**🚨 TDD CHECKPOINT (Before EACH task):**
- Does test file exist for implementation you're about to write?
- Was test written BEFORE implementation code (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)?
- **If code written before test → DELETE CODE, write test first**
- **TDD skill will auto-activate to enforce this**

#### a. Navigate to the task

- Identify the file and action required
- Read existing related files if modifying
- Check if file exists (for UPDATE tasks)

#### b. Implement the task

- **Follow the detailed specifications exactly**
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Include proper type annotations (Java) or types (TypeScript)
- Add structured logging where appropriate
- Follow naming conventions from the plan

#### c. Verify as you go

- After each file change, check syntax
- Ensure imports are correct
- Verify types are properly defined

#### d. Run validation command

**CRITICAL:** Run the validation command specified in the task:

```bash
# Example validation commands from tasks
cd backend && mvn clean compile
mvn test -Dtest=ExampleServiceTest
```

**If validation fails:**
- Fix the issue
- Re-run the validation command
- Continue only when it passes

**DO NOT skip validation!** Each task has a validation command for a reason.

### 5. Implement Testing Strategy

**🚨 TDD REMINDER: Tests should be written FIRST (RED phase), not after implementation!**

If you followed TDD correctly in section 4, tests are already written.
If not, **DELETE implementation code** and start over with test-first approach.

After completing implementation tasks:

- **Create all test files** specified in the plan
- **Implement all test cases** mentioned
- **Follow the testing approach** outlined in the plan
- **Ensure tests cover edge cases**

**Run tests after creating each test file:**

```bash
# Backend unit tests
mvn test -Dtest=NewServiceTest

# Backend integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=NewControllerIT

# Frontend tests
npm test -- NewComponent.test.tsx
```

### 6. Run All Validation Commands

Execute **ALL validation commands** from the plan in order:

```bash
# Level 1: Backend Compilation
cd backend && mvn clean compile

# Level 2: Backend Unit Tests
cd backend && mvn test

# Level 3: Backend Integration Tests
cd backend && mvn verify -DskipUnitTests=true

# Level 4: Test Coverage
cd backend && mvn jacoco:report

# Level 5: Frontend Build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Level 6: Manual Validation
# (Feature-specific manual testing steps)
```

**If any command fails:**

1. Identify the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the failed command
4. Continue only when it passes

**DO NOT proceed to next validation level until current level passes!**

### 7. Final Verification

## Notes

**If you encounter issues not addressed in the plan:**

1. **Document them** in the execution report
2. **Explain why** you deviated from the plan
3. **Describe the solution** you implemented

**If tests fail:**

1. Fix implementation until tests pass
2. DO NOT modify tests to make them pass
3. Ensure tests are testing correct behavior

**If validation commands fail:**

1. Identify root cause
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the validation command
4. Continue until all validations pass

**Important:**
- Don't skip validation steps
- Don't skip reading "MUST READ" files
- Don't deviate from plan without documenting why
- Don't proceed until each validation passes

## Next Steps (AUTOMATIC)

**IMPORTANT:** The following steps now run AUTOMATICALLY to ensure code quality.

### Automatic Validation Flow

After implementation completes, the system will **automatically**:

1. **Run Code Review** - Technical quality analysis
   - Checks for bugs, security issues, performance problems
   - Verifies PIV standards compliance
   - Checks TDD compliance (tests written before code)
   - If issues found → Auto-fix and re-review

2. **Run System Review** (Parallel) - Process improvement analysis
   - Analyzes PIV process quality
   - Documents lessons learned
   - Identifies future improvements (doesn't block)

3. **Run Final Validation** - Complete validation suite
   - Environment safety check
   - Compilation verification
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - TDD compliance check (🚨 HARD STOP if violations detected)
   - Coverage check (≥80%)
   - Security scan
   - Build verification

4. **Ready State** - Stop when all pass
   - Report: "✅ FEATURE COMPLETE - ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED"
   - Summary: Files created, tests added, coverage achieved
   - Next step: **Ask user about committing**

### What You Need To Do

**During automatic flow:**
- Watch progress (you'll see each step running)
- If manual fixes needed → System will ask you
- If automatic fixes possible → System will apply them
- Loop until all validations pass

**When feature is complete:**
- You'll see: "✅ READY TO COMMIT"
- Review the summary
- **System will ASK: "Ready to commit implementation?"**
- Respond with "yes" to commit or "no" to make changes

### Phase-Based Commit Workflow

**Implementation Phase Commit (current phase):**

After automatic validation passes:

**Step 1: System asks for permission**
```
✅ FEATURE COMPLETE - ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED

Ready to commit implementation? (yes/no)
```

**Step 2: If you say "yes"**
```bash
/commit
```
This creates a commit with:
- All implementation changes (code + tests written in TDD order)
- Commit message follows conventional commits
- Includes co-author attribution

**Step 3: Push to remote**
```bash
git push -u origin <your-feature-branch>
```

**Step 4: Create Pull Request**
```bash
gh pr create --title "Feature: <brief description>" --body "Summary of changes"
```

**Step 5: Merge to main (ONLY after review and approval)**
- ✅ Pull request must be reviewed
- ✅ All checks must pass
- ✅ Get **explicit approval** from maintainer
- Then merge to main

**IMPORTANT:**
- ❌ **NEVER** commit directly to main without approval
- ❌ **NEVER** push directly to main branch
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use feature branches for implementations
- ✅ **ALWAYS** create PR for review before merging to main
- ✅ **System ASKS before committing** - never automatic

### Manual Override (Optional)

If you want to skip automatic validation and run manually:

```bash
# Skip automatic flow, run individual commands
/validation:code-review
/validation:code-review-fix <report-path>
/validation:validate
```

**But why?** Automatic flow ensures consistent quality and catches issues early.

---

**Remember:** The goal is one-pass implementation with automatic quality gates. If you followed the plan and all validations pass, you succeeded! 🎉
